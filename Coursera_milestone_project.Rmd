## Introduction 

This is the Milestone Report for the Coursera Data Science Capstone project. This report shows the results of exploratory analysis and outlines the goals for the eventual application and algorithm.

## Data

The data were download from the path: "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip"
Following ti



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
